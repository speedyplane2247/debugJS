# debugJS
An open-source alternative for native javascript that doesn't offer its source.
## Why?
If you've ever seen something when looking for modifying part of a website, you might get the annoying "native code" message. You can overwrite these functions, but if you're looking for the actual code to modify, good luck. This set of libraries allows your users to modify the code of each function and view it as well.
